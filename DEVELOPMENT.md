## Package.json Scripts

This section explains the purpose and functionality of the various scripts defined
in the `package.json` file. These scripts are used to streamline tasks such as
cleaning, building, testing, linting, formatting, and preparing the project.

## Workflow Configuration

Our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is configured to ensure that the project
maintains high quality through automated testing, linting, formatting, and
security scans.

### Issue and Pull Request Cleanup

The project uses an automated stale issue and pull request cleanup workflow to
ensure that inactive issues and PRs do not clutter the repository.

- Issues become stale after **30 days** of inactivity and are labeled as `stale`.
- Stale issues are closed automatically after **7 days** if no activity occurs.
- Pull requests become stale after **30 days** and are closed after **10 days**
  if no further action is taken.
- Issues and PRs with specific labels (e.g., `no-stale`, `help-wanted`) are
  exempt from this process.

This automation helps keep the repository manageable and ensures that active
discussions are prioritized.

### Label Synchronization

The project uses an automated workflow to ensure consistent issue and pull
request labels. This synchronization process helps maintain structured issue
management and simplifies repository maintenance.

- The workflow runs when changes are pushed to the **main** branch that modify
  the `.github/labels.yml` file.
- Labels defined in `.github/labels.yml` are automatically synchronized across
  the repository.
- Synchronization can also be triggered manually using **workflow dispatch**.
- Ensures a standardized and structured issue labeling system.
- Prevents label inconsistencies when working with multiple contributors.
- Reduces manual label management effort.

By automating label synchronization, the project maintains consistency and
reduces manual work, making issue tracking more efficient.
